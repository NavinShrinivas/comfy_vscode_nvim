# VsCode Comfy nvim config 
Repo containing nvim config files which is quite comfy for develompers coming from vscode , although this definetly has some stuff that needs getting used to/ 
#### Clone the repo to nvim folder in .config folder (/home/user_name/.config/nvim)[Create folder if it doesnt exist] , This should be default if you havent changed the XDG HOME path , if you have should be able to figure it out yourself.
#### After that, you just have to open your ```init.vim```, probably located at ```/home/your_user/.config/nvim```, press ```ESC```, and then type ```:PlugInstall``` to auto-detect the plugins and install them

#### the below lines I havent used in my personal setup , but its still here : 
#### To display the icons correctly, make sure your terminal is using a Nerd Font, here is the link to check the fonts: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#patched-fonts
